# Object Detection using TensorFlow.js and React.js

## Project description

The TensorFlow.js _coco-ssd_ (Common Objects in Context Single Shot Detection) model takes input from the user's camera, and returns an array of bounding boxes with class name and confidence level which are displayed using React components.

The model can detect 80 classes of objects. [Here is a full list of the object classes.](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/coco-ssd/src/classes.ts)

## Requirements

## Running the program

## Screenshot

![Screenshot of puppies being detected](screenshot.jpeg?raw=true 'Screenshot of puppies being detected')

## Technologies used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js
- React.js
- Node.JS

## Extra feature ideas

- Allow the user to upload files for detection.
